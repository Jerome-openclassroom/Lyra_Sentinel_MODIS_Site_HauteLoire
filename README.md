# Lyra_Sentinel_MODIS_Site_HauteLoire

**A reproducible remote sensing pipeline combining Sentinel-2 NDVI and MODIS LST for a selected ecological site in Haute-Loire, France.**

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a compact, transparent workflow to extract and monitor two key biophysical variables:
- **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** ‚Äî Sentinel-2 Harmonized, clipped to a 1 km ROI.
- **Land Surface Temperature (LST)** ‚Äî MODIS MOD11A1, averaged over a 5 km buffer.

Both metrics are computed for a precise point located in Haute-Loire, representing a semi-natural meadow-bocage ecosystem, and intended to feed into Lyra's open ecological models.

## Site Information

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Longitude** | 4.0966666 E |
| **Latitude**  | 45.0430555 N |
| **NDVI ROI (visualized)** | Square buffer ~1 km |
| **LST ROI (visualized)**  | Disk buffer ~5 km |
| **Time period** | May 15 ‚Äî June 15, 2025 |

## Results

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Mean NDVI** | ~0.85 (2 decimal places) |
| **Mean LST (¬∞C)** | ~18.8 ¬∞C (1 decimal place) |

These values reflect the site‚Äôs healthy vegetative activity and typical late spring surface temperatures in a mid-altitude French upland context.
The NDVI (~0.85) corresponds to the first clear-sky day within the 15 May ‚Äì 15 June period, ensuring high atmospheric transparency and optimal leaf reflectance, representative of maximum photosynthetic activity for this bocage site.

## Dependencies

This pipeline relies on:
- `earthengine-api`
- `geemap` (Folium mode for robust interactive map display)

Install via:
```bash
pip install earthengine-api geemap
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lyra_Sentinel_MODIS_Site_HauteLoire.git
   cd Lyra_Sentinel_MODIS_Site_HauteLoire
   ```

2. Authenticate your Google Earth Engine account inside the notebook:
   ```python
   import ee
   ee.Authenticate()
   ee.Initialize()
   ```

3. Run all cells to reproduce:
   - NDVI & LST computation
   - ROI clipping & visualization
   - CSV export to Google Drive
   - Interactive map with clear buffer overlays.

## Key Concepts

- **ROI Clipping:** NDVI visualization is clipped to a 1 km square to avoid displaying the full Sentinel-2 tile (~100 km¬≤).
- **Buffering:** LST is computed using a larger disk to smooth out thermal heterogeneity.
- **Low Precision:** Outputs are rounded to 2 decimals (NDVI) and 1 decimal (LST) for ecological realism.
